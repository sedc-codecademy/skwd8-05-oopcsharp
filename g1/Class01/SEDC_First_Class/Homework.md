# Homework 01

### Create new solution and inside create a new project (console .net core app) called trafficLight.

- Simulate a traffic light. There should be 3 lines, in first should be printed "STOP" and colored in red, in second should be printed
  "READY" and colored in yellow and finally in third should be printed "GO" and colored in green.
* Hint: Console has many more methods like WriteLn and ReadLn. You can set the background color with one of them, but note that you need
  first to set color and then to print the message on the screen. Feel free to play with other methods also and if you have some questions
  we can discuss them on the next class.
